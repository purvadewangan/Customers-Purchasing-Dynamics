# Customers-Purchasing-Dynamics
<br>

## **Overview**

This project analyzes customer shopping behaviour using an ecommerce dataset to understand spending patterns, customer segmentation, product performance, and revenue drivers. The work combines Python-based EDA, SQL analysis, and a Power BI dashboard to present insights clearly for business decision making.

<br>

## **Dataset**

The dataset contains **3900 customer purchase records** with features covering demographics, product attributes, spending behaviour, and subscription status.

<br>

## **Project Goal**

To analyze how different customers shop, identify high-value segments, evaluate product performance, and uncover factors that influence revenue, loyalty, and engagement. The project aims to support data-driven decisions for marketing, product strategy, and customer retention.

## **Business Problem**

The company is experiencing inconsistent revenue growth and wants to understand what drives customer spending across different segments. Management needs clarity on which customer groups generate the most value, which products perform best, and how factors such as discounts, subscriptions, shipping preferences, and age groups influence revenue. The goal is to uncover spending patterns, identify high-value customer segments, optimize product listings, and strengthen retention strategies to improve profitability and guide future marketing and sales decisions.
